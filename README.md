Interview prompt at local company:
>Create a command line interface (CLI) in Python which proctors a math (arithmetic) test.
>
>It should ask the user if they want to addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
>
>It asks ten questions of the category chosen.
>
>It provides the score that the user received.
>
>It then asks the user if they want to take another one.

Note: the default test length in my implementation is 3 questions. This can be changed prior to starting the test (see the 'help' command).
